class CourseSimilarity:
    """
    Class for holding course similarity measures.
    This allows for easier sorting and reporting of similarities
    compared to previous solution of (sim: float, from_course: Course) tuples

    When a course is evaluated, its evaluation is stored as a new
    CourseSimilarity object. Evaluations are then stored as lists of
    CourseSimilarity objects, which can then be sorted easily based on
    similarity scores.

    CourseSimilarity objects essentially behave as annotated floats.
    All boolean and arithmetic operations are defined to operate on
    just the score member variable, allowing for e.g. sorting lists of
    CourseSimilarity scores, or finding average similarities.
